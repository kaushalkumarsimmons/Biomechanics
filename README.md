Attached you find the Struct ‘StructTrial’ with some pilot data.

1. Read-in the struct (MAT file). It contains full-body kinematic and kinetic data of 2 subjects for several conditions, with data arrays being time-normalized (1-1001 samples) for both standing up (_STD) - from sitting still (start) to standing still (stop) - and sitting down (_SIT) -the reverse-. There are a few repetitions for each condition.
2. Plot for both subjects in a single plot for the STS_NCT_FS_SIT condition the average left hip angle in the y dimension with fitting figure labels.
3. Give me the average peak hip value during the second part of stance, being from seat-off (which can be found in the Events field) to standing, for both subjects for the mentioned condition. 
4. Indicate the value found for 3) in the figure at the appropriate time instance. 
5. I want to know the total COP trajectory in the horizontal plane (x,y) that is traveled / moved during standing up for the STS_NCT_FS condition. Center of pressure is measured by two force plates – each under one foot, the data can be found in the .B (Body) field.

Please send me the file with the Python code or share Jupyter if you do it in Python, or the .m file if you do it in Matlab. And the figure + peak value.
